                                I joined as lateral hire in Capgemini, Chennai, five months back. It is like any other service based company however a few points below makes Capgemini different from other service based companies in India:

                                I got my ID card after 1 week of joining the company. It took another 2 days for the access card to get activated. I was asked to submit a passport size photograph since they didn’t have any photo of mine in their database. I submitted 16 copies of my passport size photograph on the first day and soft copies already mailed to the recruiter and uploaded in the internal employee portal YET the ID Cell team did not have my photograph.
                                I was asked to report at 10:30 am in the morning on my second day and contact the POC once I reach the office. I called him a couple of times and he did not receive my call. I figured he might be stuck in traffic. He finally decided to meet at 12pm and the first question he asked was why did you keep on calling me? You should have simply waited. Turns out this POC doesn't reach the office before 12 pm in the noon.
                                I was informed I am bench and I would have to give client interviews to grab a project. I had already cleared 3 rounds of technical interview yet they did not have open projects to allocate me to.
                                I spent 3 months in bench pool before I got a project. The 3 months was spent giving interviews for support projects with big banking clients, refusing them because I was not interested in a support role and repeatedly sending my relieving letter to various Capgemini HRs, even though I had sent all my documents to HR countless times.
                                I got my original offer letter after full 2 months of joining the company.
                                I applied for sodexo meal card after my first month of joining the company. Its been 5 months now and while 2000rs is getting deducted from my salary every month, I dont have the card yet. When you contact the representatives they tell you its in progress and to wait. Its been 5 months already. How much more should I wait I wonder.
                                There is no sick leave mechanism with CG. Every month 2 leaves are added to your account. Compared to other MNCs it is very less. Every leave is a privilege leave here.
                                I was informed I got project in Bangalore and to pack my bags and report there next week. 2 days and I am again informed banglore project is not happened. Actually I was not informed. I had to specifically ask my manager when should I report in Bangalore and then it was formed.
                                Yes you are literally forced to work in support projects with threats of termination and poor appraisal ratings. A lateral hire is treated the same way as the next naive fresh graduate that joins the company.
                                For 1 whole month my friend could not navigate through their internal employee portal because her access was blocked as she was tagged to wrong BU and location. It took 1 whole month to resolve and rectify the issue after umpteen number of mails and incident tickets raised.
                                Everybody says work culture at CG is good. What exactly does it mean?Things work at snail’s pace here and its an overtly relaxed envirnoment with unnecesaary over the top employee engagement activities.
                                These are just the general things. I am not going to talk about the internal project workings as it differs for each individual. Go figure how the company is.

                                My review:

                                You wiill not know who is the HR person.

                                Do you have problem with leaves? raise ticket.

                                Do you want to understand pay structure or salary slip? raise ticket.

                                Do you feel harassed? raise ticket or send mail.

                                Everything can not be explained in portal, you need a human face to talk to, but they don't understand.

                                Even if you find HR, you will find government officers more polite and helpful.

                                Do you need to install a software for project?Raise ticket and wait for atleast 5 days.Even if deadlines are near, manager will say- he can't help, just find your way, I can't help in company's processes.

                                In Mumbai Vikhroli office, are you on bench? We do not provide you computer, there is no recreation room(chess, TT, gym,…), but you need to be in office for 9.5 hours. The library is having only tecnical or management books. We do not believe in reading current affairs.

                                Fortunately Patni(igate) ofc is having recreation facilities.

                                Is there a festival and you find baloons in ofc? Must be of blue and white colours. We xan endorse only Capgemini colours.

                                Company is doing great, please buy our ESOPs, oh is it Diwali? we do not have money, can't even give a small single penda.

                                You are exceptional performer. But wait, that guy has resigned, we will promote him.You willget a hike or promotion when you will resign.

                                Complete 40 hrs of trainings a year, but wait, classroom trainings are expensive. Just do the b***shit virtual trainings and complete 40 hrs without learning a single thing.

                                Are you a male? You must wear shoes. Is it raining, we don't care, just get your leather shoes.

                                Are you a female, women legs are fine for the show off. Dont wear shoes or closed chappals.

                                Are you in M4/M4A building and standing in queue in canteen for the bill? wait there is the HR/admin girl getting it directly and she doesn't pay many times.

                                I was part of Igate before merger of CG and Igate. We were very happy with all the process and recognition we received during Igate period. After merger we are feeling like we are part of some government company (even Govt companies will be better i guess). In simple words we can say Capgemini has no ethics no morals when it comes to employee benefits, rewards, recognition and well being. All they care about how they can earn more money and how they can cheat and loot employees of their hard earned money.

                                If employee resigns during mid year, CG will not pay his variable pay saying you have not served full cycle. Agreed but at least pay based on his number of months worked. Why are you keeping his/her hard earned money ?
                                CG sending or say deputing people from Noida office to Bangalore client office. Before deputing CG managers say they will provide deputation allowance of 1k/day. So employee will be happy and shifts his location. After working for 6 months and lot of follow ups some idiotic manager tells him that policy has been changed you will not receive any allowance. What the hell is this ? Are you serious ? Is that policy is like manufactures advertisements “Specifications will be changed without prior notice to customer”
                                Here in CG, king of kingdom are HR’s and they won’t even care what manager thinks and asks them to do. Managers are like beggars and they have to literally beg HR for everything where HR’s do not understand ABC of IT jargon's.
                                Don’t have to tell about hike of Capgemini. It’s already butt of all jokes and viral in all platforms. Capgemini slogan says “People First” and the way treat employees is like shit.
                                Capgemini India CEO Mr Kandula was bad HR who was puppet below Mr Phanish Murthy during Igate, now acting as India CEO of CG. Mr Kandula can not speak regular English for more than 5 minutes (We have watched him in many live town hall sessions during Igate) not sure how Capgemini management tolerating him especially after his foolish statement to media.
                                Capgemini designation is another joke. We have 2 year experience guy and 10 year experience guy with same designation of Associate Consultant. No respect for senior people. Senior managers directly say they do not require experienced employees and they can manage with 3 to 4 years of experience employees.
                                Capgemini is the worst company to stay and work. They do not give damn about employee growth, safety, wellness, recognition.
                                If you do not have any offer then only join CG with the mindset of leaving the company within 1 to 2 years

                                Best place to work.Let me tell you why?

                                1)If you are a talented individual and aspiring to prepare for MBA,UPSC,Govt exams,GRE,TOEFL,State PSCs;then go for Capgemini.

                                I have joined in Vikhroli office of Capgemini. It is a huge office.M4(name of a building) has a 24×7 open library. So apparently you can study there 24×7 without any disturbance.Pantry is nearby. So you can have unlimited cups of tea/coffee and biscuits and mineral water.

                                It is very likely that you will be in bench for more than 3 months since joining. So study well during those days.

                                And you will get many colleagues who are also preparing for many exams. Gradually you will feel that you are not coming to office rather you are in a college where you have independence to study whenever you want.

                                Even some of Capgemini libraries have Indian Polity by Laxmikanth and Geography by Majid Hussain.Libraries keep almost all news papers except The Hindu.

                                Many of my friends got into IIMs or top B-schools.Work and simultaneous study which is a myth in manufacturing industry is quite a reality in IT companies.

                                2)You will enjoy freedom of speech.You can always put your own opinion even in front of the top most in the hierarchy.

                                In front of every desk,you will see “Speak Up” sticker.This is a provision where you can escalate sexual harassment at workplace to top level management.

                                3)Capgemini has the most inclusive environment where you can see differently abled persons,LGBT workers and gender equality.All offices are differently abled persons friendly i.e.if you click wheel chair button in the lift,algorithm is so set that lift will reach you first prior to other liftgoers.

                                4)You will call “SIR” to noone which is a typical corporate culture.

                                All employees have the same ID card so you can't bifurcate anyone just looking at them.Senior-junior gap is almost nil.

                                5)Friday is a casual day. So you can wear anything on that day. You will get to see the MOST beautiful looks of girls and boys on that day.I used to roam around building to building to look for beautiful girls.

                                It may not be good for you sometimes.Why?

                                1)Complaint regarding your salary.During first one or two years,if you are in bench frequently,you are contributing nothing to the company. Morever just after training,your efficiency may be very less compared to your experienced colleagues. So you may get rating 3(average) which can be justified because you are still not an asset to the company.

                                I have heard many complaints from individuals while I was working there.But overall I have enjoyed working with Capgemini.
